Try doing something that calms you and makes you happy such as an activity that you enjoy, this will rejuvenate your body and mind and allow you to return to the problem and reasses it calmly. Looking at the big picture will help you take control of the situation and move forward in a productive way."  
  
ad2 = "You have moderate anxiety which mean that you have somewhat lost perspective and blown things way out of proportion.  Take a deep breath, evaluate your problem(s) and try to better understand your role in it.  You can only control your own actions so if you are worrying about things that you cannot fix or change try to not think about those factors.  This will reduce your stress and somewhat clear your head.  "
  
ad3 = "If you are seriously stressed and you feel that your problem is too big to handle then it is definitely time to talk to an adult.  Talk to someone that you trust and if you are panicking tell them this so they can help you feel safe and assured.  Try talking to someone older, a mentor or person that you trust about your issue and take their views into consideration.  A second opinion is always good for getting things back into perspective and shining a new light on a solution from a different angle"
